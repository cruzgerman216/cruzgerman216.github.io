In this blog, I like to share to you my process in making this instagram clone made in sinatra. 

I was wondering what sort of project to make and I did not want to go through the phase of "what the idea should be" or "a new idea that no one else had created before" because that will just take up too much time. Instead, I decided to create something that was already made and that was the desktop version of instagram. 

When making instagram there were technology constraints such as uploading images or videos and not having enough javascript knowledge to manipulate the dom in certain webpages. That being said, it acted like instagram except for the messaging which I'll get into shortly.

The difficult part of making this project was the design and the thought processe going about this. The project setup is an mvc format. What took up most time was having bootstrap 4 in all webpages. This took me a week to go through the design as I was rusty in css and html. 

Overall, this project was fun and I learned a lot.
