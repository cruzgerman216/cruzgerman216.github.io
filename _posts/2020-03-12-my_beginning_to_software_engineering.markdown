Like all beginnings, sometimes more random than others, my inclination to software engineering just happenned. 

Back in 2014, I took my first ever programming class at my local university. It was tough at first, learning the terminal, the syntax to C++ and really getting use to the programming jargon. I always thought programming led to this crazy amount of imagination but turned out, it's a skill anybody can pick up. 

The first couple of months were difficult but also enjoyable. It wasn't like anything I had done before in terms of school work. It was fun, hard and most importantly rewarding. I still remember the day I came to class and my professor congratulated me in my high test score. The next couple of C++ classes involved sorting algorithms and data structures which was more difficult than I thought. Although the classes were tough, I never gave up and that's when I knew software engineering was for me.

Years have gone past and still I have fallen into the same pathway that is software engineering. This past month I have enrolled in flatiron March 02, 2020 and it is great to be back to school with students with the same passion as I do.
