This web application ties the relationship between clients and paraprofessionals in setting appointments and also gathering user confirmation for insurance and authorization(legal) purposes. 

**Behind the scenes**

A chellenging task I've ever face was making this webapp. The planning, design and architecture is by far the most thought about app I've design in my history of making web apps. In an MVC, I've tried to model a role type user base where program coordinators are able to full access create and deleting appointments. Behavioral Interventionist and clients aren't able to create appointments and render sessions which enables the PC to allow trust for legal purposes. 

**Problems with the web app**

So far my web app features a clone to NPA Go, a company design to create software for people with autism and special needs. The app does not feature add ons such as creating your own account or logging in with google authorization. This might be because of misuse usage from non-clients. 

**Final thoughts**

Although the app is a clone of the NPA Go version, it sure was fun making and designing it.
